This is a NextJS project showing how to use TSE's design system library, [Constellation](https://github.com/TritonSE/TSE-Constellation), in a project.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies (the `--force` flag is due to a React dependency conflict with one of Constellation's dependencies, I am working on a better solution):

```sh
npm install --force
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the site.
